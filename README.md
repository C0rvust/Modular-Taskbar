# Modular-Taskbar
A Rainmeter skin that acts as a taskbar replacement. 

This skin **does not** effect your stock Windows Taskbar in any way; should you choose to remove it (by whatever means avaliable) is your freedom.

The minimum required version of Rainmeter is version [4.4 Beta Release - r3382](https://www.rainmeter.net/).
